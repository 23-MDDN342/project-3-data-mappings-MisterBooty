## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

This code is a p5.js creation that is designed to map a cartoon parameised face on real life humanoid faces. The design of the face alludes from aesthetics of classic betty boop, steamboat willie and cuphead animation. This inspiration has been mixed in with my own cartoon drawing style and aesthetic and I am very happy with how it presents. The face contains five features; eyes, nose, ears, mouth and an extra decoration.
This face is trained to distinguish certain features such as:

Eye Shade, Age, facial accessories, Hair colour and Mouth Expression.

Each of these features are connected to the five different facial features and their 4 variations I included on the face design.

Eye Shade → Eyetype: Dark Eyes with Makeup/Dead Eyes, Dark Eyes/Surprised Eyes, Light Eyes/Suspicious Eyes, Light Eyes with Makeup/Scared Eyes.

Mouth Expression → MouthType: Smile/Scared Mouth, Smile with Teeth/Happy Mouth,  Neutral/Bucktooth Mouth,  ‘Ooo’ Mouth/Whistle Mouth.

Hair Colour → NoseType: Red/Plastic Nose, Brunette/Pimple Nose, Blonde/Pinocchio Nose, Black/Round  Nose.

Facik Accessoriess → EarType:  Earrings /Earring Ear, Facial hair/Elf Ears,  Nothing /Large Ears, Necklace/HeadPhones.
