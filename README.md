## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings
09/05/23

Created two separate images of poses and expressions for the sketch exercise. I’m wanting to carry on my style and design from project two. I also really like the idea of adding accessories or different faces shapes depending on the type of person they are mapped to.

Impleneted my facial base of my previous porject into this set of code. Got the vairbless i need working as well as colour.

Next step is to create the eyes outh and nose, then futher on down the line I need to work on how create a system in which the face changes the directions it faces depending on said photo.

I have successfully implemented my code into my design!! The arcs were very different at first and were all jumbled. This is because I needed to change my angle mode to radians instead of degrees. Unfortunately, my face seems to be rotating too much to be mapped probably as shown above. I need to figure this out first, then I can work on implementing positions for the eyes, mouth, nose,ears and extras.

Fixed the angle mode problem in which the face points were jumbled and my code was doing somersaults. Each of the sliders are now working perfectly with each facial feature and they are named. The next step is to get the positions working and train the machine learning. I would also like to do something cool with colour but I’m not sure if that is possible within my timeframe.

started implementing the postions into the first set f eyes. I realsied it needs trranslate so i dont have to do heaps of math. This also requires push and pops.
